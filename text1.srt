00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Taking that internship in a remote mountain lab

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
might not have been the best idea.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Pulling that lever with the skull symbol just to see what it did

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
probably wasn't so smart, either,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
but now is not the time for regrets

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
because you need to get away from these mutant zombies fast.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
With you are the janitor, the lab assistant, and the old professor.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You've gotten a headstart, but there's only one way to safety:

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
across an old rope bridge spanning a massive gorge.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can dash across in a minute,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
while the lab assistant takes two minutes.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The janitor is a bit slower and needs five minutes,

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and the professor takes a whole ten minutes,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
holding onto the ropes every step of the way.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
By the professor's calculations,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the zombies will catch up to you in just over 17 minutes,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
so you only have that much time to get everyone across and cut the ropes.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Unfortunately, the bridge can only hold two people at a time.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
To make matters worse,

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
it's so dark out that you can barely see,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and the old lantern you grabbed on your way only illuminates a tiny area.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Can you figure out a way to have everyone escape in time?

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Remember: no more than two people can cross the bridge together,

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
anyone crossing must either hold the lantern or stay right next to it,

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and any of you can safely wait in the dark on either side of the gorge.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Most importantly, everyone must be safely across before the zombies arrive.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Otherwise, the first zombie could step on the bridge while people are still on it.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Finally, there are no tricks to use here.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You can't swing across,

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
use the bridge as a raft,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
or befriend the zombies.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself!

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Answer in: 3

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Answer in: 2

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Answer in: 1

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
At first it might seem like no matter what you do,

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you're just a minute or two short of time, but there is a way.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The key is to minimize the time wasted by the two slowest people

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
by having them cross together.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And because you'll need to make a couple of return trips with the lantern,

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you'll want to have the fastest people available to do so.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So, you and the lab assistant quickly run across with the lantern,

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
though you have to slow down a bit to match her pace.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
After two minutes, both of you are across,

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and you, as the quickest, run back with the lantern.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Only three minutes have passed.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So far, so good.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Now comes the hard part.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The professor and the janitor take the lantern and cross together.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This takes them ten minutes

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
since the janitor has to slow down for the old professor

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
who keeps muttering

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
that he probably shouldn't have given the zombies night vision.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
By the time they're across, there are only four minutes left,

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and you're still stuck on the wrong side of the bridge.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But remember, the lab assistant has been waiting on the other side,

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and she's the second fastest of the group.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So she grabs the lantern from the professor

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and runs back across to you.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now with only two minutes left, the two of you make the final crossing.

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
As you step on the far side of the gorge,

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
you cut the ropes and collapse the bridge behind you,

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
just in the nick of time.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Maybe next summer, you'll just stick to the library.
